INTRODUCTION
 # ðŸ§© Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS repository!

This repository has been created to document and demonstrate the process of REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS in the context of software development specifically through the example of building an Airbnb Clone Application.

The purpose of this repository is to outline how project requirements are identified, analyzed, and structured before the design and development stages begin. It serves as a learning resource to understand the importance of clear and well-defined requirements in delivering successful software products.



WHAT IS REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS?

 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of end-users and stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented.  

It involves defining what the software should do and how it should perform, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the projectâ€™s objectives before development begins.

During this phase, software engineers, project managers, and clients collaborate to identify the functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system should perform) requirements of the project.  

 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

1. Clarity of Objectives: Helps ensure that developers and clients share a common understanding of the softwareâ€™s goals.  
2. Reduces Development Errors: By identifying requirements early, potential issues or misunderstandings can be addressed before coding starts.  
3. Efficient Resource Management: Clear requirements help in estimating time, cost, and resources accurately.  
4. Improves Quality Assurance: Well-defined requirements make it easier to test and validate that the final product meets user expectations.  
5. Supports Better Design Decisions:A detailed analysis provides a foundation for creating scalable, user-friendly, and maintainable systems.

In short, requirement analysis acts as the blueprint of the software project guiding every stage from design and implementation to testing and deployment.
